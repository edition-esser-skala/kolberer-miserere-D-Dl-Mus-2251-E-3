  –    & –    & \B1 has been written by Copyist Zelenka 1 and substantially
                revised by Jan Dismas Zelenka.
                Bars 60–75, 106–122, and 212–225 are entirely in Zelenka’s hand.
                It is unclear whether the abbreviation “G:K:” on the title page
                truly refers to Kolberer as the author.
                Although the title page mentions two oboes ad libitum,
                the manuscript does not indicate that oboes should play. \\
